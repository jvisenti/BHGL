Demo project is Ray Wenderlich's tutorial on OpelGL for iOS (http://www.raywenderlich.com/3664/opengl-es-2-0-for-iphone-tutorial) adapted to use the BHGL framework.

The aim of using this tutorial is to provide a reference point for how the same functionality can be achieved with both direct gl calls and using BHGL.
